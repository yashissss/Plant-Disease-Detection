# Plant Disease Detection
A simple ML and DL based website which recommends the diseases caught by your crops.Crop diseases pose a significant threat to global food security, agricultural sustainability, and socio-economic stability. As the world's population continues to grow, the demand for food increases, placing additional pressure on agricultural systems to produce higher yields. However, the presence of crop diseases undermines these efforts by causing substantial yield losses, estimated to range from 20% to 40% globally each year. These losses not only impact farmers' incomes but also have broader implications for food availability, prices, and access, particularly in vulnerable regions with limited resources and infrastructure.
